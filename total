#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
	unsigned int x = 1;
	unsigned int total = 0;
	unsigned int y;

	while ( x <= 10 ) {
		y = x * x;
		printf( "%d\n", y );
		total += y;
		++x;
	}

	printf( "Total is %d\n", total );
}


This program prints the values of y first which are 1 * 1 or 1, 2 * 2 or 4, 3 * 3 or 9, etc. 
So it prints 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 or the values of y, and then it adds those 
values all up into the total which is 385.
